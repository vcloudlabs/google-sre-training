# üìà Service Level Indicator (SLI) ‚Äì Deep Dive

## What is an SLI?
A **Service Level Indicator (SLI)** is a carefully defined quantitative measure of some aspect of the level of service that is provided. SLIs are the foundation of SLOs and SLAs, and they help in assessing whether users are experiencing the desired reliability and performance.

SLI is a specific measurement that tells you how well a service is working from the user‚Äôs point of view.

## Characteristics of a Good SLI
- **User-Centric**: Reflects the user's experience with the service
- **Quantifiable**: Can be measured with real metrics
- **Relevant**: Maps to critical service behavior
- **Actionable**: Enables alerting, improvements, or incident response

## Common SLI Types
- **Availability** ‚Äì How often is the service reachable?
- **Latency** ‚Äì How fast is the service?
- **Error Rate** ‚Äì How frequently does it fail?
- **Durability** ‚Äì Is data safe and not corrupted?
- **Freshness** ‚Äì Is data up-to-date?

## SLI Formula Example
```text
SLI = (Number of successful requests / Total requests) * 100
```
