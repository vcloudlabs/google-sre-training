# What is Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)?

**Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)** is a discipline that applies **software engineering practices** to **infrastructure and operations** tasks. The goal is to build systems that are **scalable**, **automated**, and **highly reliable**.

---

## ðŸ”§ Example: Software Engineering Practices Used in SRE

| Practice                 | How It's Used in SRE                                                 |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Coding & Automation**  | Writing scripts or tools to automate deployments, backups, scaling, etc. |
| **Version Control**      | Managing infrastructure with tools like Git and Terraform             |
| **Testing**              | Using automated tests for infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines          |
| **Code Reviews**         | Reviewing operational changes such as configuration files or deployment logic |
| **Design Patterns**      | Applying patterns for high availability, fault tolerance, and resilience |

##ðŸ”¹ Core Principles
- **Embrace Risk:** Error budgets, Service Level Objectives (SLOs)

- **Service Level Management:** SLOs, SLIs, SLAs

- **Eliminate Toil:** Automate repetitive tasks

- **Monitoring & Alerting**

- **Release Engineering & CI/CD**

- **Incident Management & Postmortems**

- **Capacity Planning & Scaling**

- **Production Readiness Reviews**

## Key Characteristics of Google's SRE Approach

| Principle                   | Description                                                        |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Engineering-Focused Ops     | Use code to automate and improve operations                        |
| Service-Level Objectives    | Define and measure reliability with SLIs, SLOs, and error budgets  |
| Blameless Culture           | Learn from failures without assigning blame                        |
| Toil Elimination            | Reduce manual and repetitive work through automation               |
| Balance Risk and Velocity   | Allow fast innovation while maintaining acceptable reliability      |
