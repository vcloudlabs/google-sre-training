# Google SRE


Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is a discipline that incorporates aspects of software engineering and applies them to infrastructure and operations problems. The goal is to create scalable and highly reliable software systems.

##ðŸ”¹ Core Principles
- **Embrace Risk:** Error budgets, Service Level Objectives (SLOs)

- **Service Level Management:** SLOs, SLIs, SLAs

- **Eliminate Toil:** Automate repetitive tasks

- **Monitoring & Alerting**

- **Release Engineering & CI/CD**

- **Incident Management & Postmortems**

- **Capacity Planning & Scaling**

- **Production Readiness Reviews**

| Principle                   | Description                                                        |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Engineering-Focused Ops     | Use code to automate and improve operations                        |
| Service-Level Objectives    | Define and measure reliability with SLIs, SLOs, and error budgets  |
| Blameless Culture           | Learn from failures without assigning blame                        |
| Toil Elimination            | Reduce manual and repetitive work through automation               |
| Balance Risk and Velocity   | Allow fast innovation while maintaining acceptable reliability      |
